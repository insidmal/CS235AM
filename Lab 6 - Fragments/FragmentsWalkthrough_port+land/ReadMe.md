This is the source code for the [Fragment Walkthrough](http://docs.xamarin.com/android/tutorials/Fragments_Walkthrough). 

There are two projects included with this solution:

- `SupportLibFragments` is the project that shows how to use fragments with a support package for devices running Android 1.6 or higher.
